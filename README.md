# FireDuck vs Pandas: A Comparison of Python Data Manipulation Libraries

## Overview

**FireDuck** is a high-performance DataFrame library designed to handle large datasets efficiently. It is known for its optimized execution and faster processing times when compared to traditional libraries like **Pandas**, especially when dealing with large or complex datasets.

In this README, we will compare **FireDuck** and **Pandas** in terms of core features, performance, and use cases. We will also provide some examples demonstrating the key differences between the two.

## Key Differences Between FireDuck and Pandas

### 1. **Performance**

* **FireDuck**:

  * Optimized for high-performance data manipulation, especially for large datasets.
  * Implements columnar data storage and retrieval similar to **Apache Arrow**, resulting in faster computation and memory efficiency.
  * Can handle larger-than-memory datasets due to its efficient memory management.
* **Pandas**:

  * Popular and highly used, but can become slower with larger datasets.
  * While efficient for many use cases, it can face memory bottlenecks when dealing with very large datasets, especially when the dataset exceeds system memory.

### 2. **Memory Usage**

* **FireDuck**:

  * Uses less memory and supports **out-of-core** computation (i.e., it can work with data that doesn’t fit into memory).
  * Can process data directly from disk or over distributed systems.

* **Pandas**:

  * Memory-intensive, especially with large datasets.
  * Requires the entire dataset to fit in memory, which could lead to memory issues for big datasets.

### 3. **Syntax and API**

* **FireDuck**:

  * Designed to be simple and Pythonic, but its API is not as rich and mature as **Pandas**.
  * Focused on performance with optimized operations, but lacks some of the utility functions available in **Pandas** (like merging, reshaping, or pivoting).

* **Pandas**:

  * Mature and feature-rich API with a broad set of utilities for data manipulation (merging, pivoting, groupby, etc.).
  * Very well documented and widely adopted across industries and research.

### 4. **Parallel Processing**

* **FireDuck**:

  * Supports parallel computation out-of-the-box, allowing for faster processing on multi-core systems or distributed clusters.

* **Pandas**:

  * Lacks native support for parallel processing. You would need to use libraries like **Dask** or **Modin** for parallelism with **Pandas**.

## Installation

### FireDuck

You can install **FireDuck** using pip:

```bash
pip install fireduck
```

### Pandas

Pandas can be installed using pip as well:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Example Comparisons

### 1. **Creating DataFrames**

#### FireDuck:

```python
import fireduck as fd

# Creating a FireDuck DataFrame
data = {'A': [1, 2, 3, 4], 'B': [5, 6, 7, 8]}
df_fireduck = fd.DataFrame(data)

print(df_fireduck)
```

#### Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a Pandas DataFrame
data = {'A': [1, 2, 3, 4], 'B': [5, 6, 7, 8]}
df_pandas = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(df_pandas)
```

### 2. **Basic Operations: Filtering Rows**

#### FireDuck:

```python
# Filtering rows where column A is greater than 2
filtered_fireduck = df_fireduck[df_fireduck['A'] > 2]
print(filtered_fireduck)
```

#### Pandas:

```python
# Filtering rows where column A is greater than 2
filtered_pandas = df_pandas[df_pandas['A'] > 2]
print(filtered_pandas)
```

### 3. **Performance Comparison**

To showcase the performance difference, let’s compare both libraries with a large dataset:

#### FireDuck:

```python
import fireduck as fd
import numpy as np
import time

# Generating a large dataset (1 million rows)
large_data = {'A': np.random.rand(10**6), 'B': np.random.rand(10**6)}

# Measure the time taken for creating a FireDuck DataFrame
start_time = time.time()
df_fireduck = fd.DataFrame(large_data)
print("FireDuck DataFrame created in:", time.time() - start_time)
```

#### Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import time

# Generating a large dataset (1 million rows)
large_data = {'A': np.random.rand(10**6), 'B': np.random.rand(10**6)}

# Measure the time taken for creating a Pandas DataFrame
start_time = time.time()
df_pandas = pd.DataFrame(large_data)
print("Pandas DataFrame created in:", time.time() - start_time)
```

### 4. **Handling Missing Data**

#### FireDuck:

```python
import fireduck as fd

# Creating a DataFrame with missing values
data = {'A': [1, 2, None, 4], 'B': [5, None, 7, 8]}
df_fireduck = fd.DataFrame(data)

# Handling missing values (fill with zero)
df_fireduck.fillna(0)
print(df_fireduck)
```

#### Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a DataFrame with missing values
data = {'A': [1, 2, None, 4], 'B': [5, None, 7, 8]}
df_pandas = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Handling missing values (fill with zero)
df_pandas.fillna(0)
print(df_pandas)
```

## Use Cases

### FireDuck is Ideal for:

* Handling **large datasets** that cannot fit into memory.
* **Out-of-core** computation for efficient handling of data stored on disk or across distributed systems.
* Tasks requiring high-performance data manipulation with a focus on speed.

### Pandas is Ideal for:

* **Data analysis** on smaller datasets that fit into memory.
* Applications requiring **advanced functionalities** such as complex merging, pivoting, and reshaping.
* **Prototyping and quick data manipulation** due to its rich API and robust ecosystem of extensions.

---

## Conclusion

* **FireDuck** is a great alternative for high-performance data processing, particularly when working with **large datasets** that need to be efficiently processed.
* **Pandas** remains the most popular library for general-purpose data manipulation and is preferred when working with datasets that fit in memory or when advanced operations are required.

For use cases that require high-speed performance and the ability to handle larger-than-memory datasets, **FireDuck** is an excellent choice. However, for more general-purpose data analysis and manipulation, **Pandas** remains the go-to library due to its rich functionality, ecosystem, and community support.
